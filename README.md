_printf.c
The C standard library's printf function is used to print formatted output to the standard 
output stream, which is often the console. The header file stdio.h contains a declaration of it.
A format string and a variable number of arguments that correspond to the format specifiers in the format 
string are passed as the first and second arguments, respectively, to the printf function. 
In addition to conventional characters, the format string also contains format specifiers
which operate as special placeholders for the values of the appropriate arguments

We are provided for with the maain.c file that we are posses to tes ourown scripts.
